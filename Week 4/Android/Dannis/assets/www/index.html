There isn't magic reader coding, you typically have to come up with the formatting, naming and everything in between. A site could have some sort of naming, or tagging, for readers. That could eliminate some issues, but ultimately it comes down to proper design and execution.  </p>

                                                <p id="discInfo">I wil definitely add the GeoLocation because people need to know where to go. Wouldn't hurt to snap some images too, So I could use that... I think silly things like a shake to go back would be good too. </p>

                                                <p id="discInfo">Well, I think doing the research early and ahead of time is definitely a start. You also need to be able to see the end. Not seeing the Big Picture can result in many many refactoring hours. </p>
                                                <h6 id="discQ">Please describe any design intentions you may have for the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.</h6>
                                                <p id="discInfo">Most of my CRUD is working... So that would be good to finish that, and I think adding the few elements will also be good. I am not sure how the app is going to look on a bigger screen, so figuring out the responsiveness of the app will be neat to see.</p>
                                                <h6 id="discQ">If not covered above, please also describe any functionality intentions you may have for both the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.</h6>
                                                <p id="discInfo">I really would like to see a sign in/login part... Have some hidden elements. My app would be for the user and the developer. Obviously some things need to be not updateable.</p>
